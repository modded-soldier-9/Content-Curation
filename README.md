# Content-Curation: Finance/Securities üìàüí∞

## Project Overview üöÄ

In light of the misinformation surrounding financial securities after the GameStop incident, this project aims to provide a reliable content curation service for both technical and non-technical users. The service offers updates on subscribed securities through an HTTP API for technical users and via email for non-technical users. Users can define the frequency of updates (daily or weekly) and create a portfolio of stocks to subscribe to. The service also provides access to market data for stocks and cryptocurrencies, as well as a popular portfolio feature.
